# Development Specs

These documents are development specs and design-history artifacts.

They are useful for engine evolution and behavior audits, but `docs/guide.md` is the primary user-facing documentation.

## Files

- `component-spec.md`: v1 component language design draft.
- `spec-compliance.md`: mapping from spec rules to fixture coverage.
- `recipes-discovery-ux-plan.md`: discovery UX planning notes from prototype phase.
